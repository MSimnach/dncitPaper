# dncitPaper

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dncitPaper is to reproduce the code in the paper Deep Nonparametric Conditional Independence Tests. To simplify this, the repository can be also installed as an R-package. To reproduce the results, access to the UK Biobank brain imaging data and the corresponding meta data is necessary.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dncitPaper from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MSimnach/dncitPaper")
```
